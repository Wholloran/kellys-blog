                <p> “Travel isn’t always pretty. 
                    It isn’t always comfortable.
                    Sometimes it hurts,
                    it even breaks your heart.
                    But that’s okay.
                    
                    The journey changes you -  it should change you. 
                    It leaves marks on your memory, 
                    on your consciousness,
                    on your heart, 
                    and on your body.
                    
                    You take something with you…
                    Hopefully, you leave 
                    something good behind.”
                    -Anthony Bourdain </p>
